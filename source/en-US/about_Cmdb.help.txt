Architecture

The CMDB application consists of the following roles.

                                Data

                              Message Bus

                     Poller | Poller agent | Client

Any instance of the application can fill any of the roles without restriction.

Data

The data role abstracts access to the data store used by the CMDB. This may be
either folder containing files or MongoDB.

Message Bus

The message bus provides the communication channel between different operating
modes of the application. This is true even when a single instance is 
operating as all roles.

For example, a request for information from the CMDB is added onto the message
bus and retrieved by the data service.

Similarly, requests to update information held on specific nodes are added to
the message bus and retrieved by the pollers.

Poller

The poller is responsible for executing Get or Import requests defined in a 
CmdbItem.

A poller may be configured as an agent. An agent will only execute items from a
queue where it is listed as the executor. Items with no executor tag may be
executed by any poller which is not configured as an agent.

An agent poller is most likely to be used when extracting data from an isolated
network segment.
